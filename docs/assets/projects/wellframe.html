      <h2>Context & Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Wellframe is a healthcare management company that links users of its mobile app with care 
        managers to aid with treatment plans, medication reminders, daily wellness, and more.
        In January 2022, Wellframe held its  <strong>first ever company-wide hackathon!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The theme of the hackathon was "My Ideal Wellframe" -- where we were tasked to develop a new
        feature for any part of the organization, whether it be user facing changes, dashboard-wide, 
        or data analytics. My team, the mobile team with primarily iOS devs, took on the challenge of
        making the app more "techy" and  <strong>implementing Siri</strong>, and we named our team "LITT"
        after a podcast had referenced Siri as the "Lady in the Tube" to avoid setting her off; a funny
        obstacle my team and I ran into plenty during the hackathon.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Process & Approach</h2>
      <p>
        In my team of five with me being one of the two developers, we decided to tackle one of the 
        most used features of the app: reminders. Reminders works by prefilling all of the assumed
        details of the reminder and allowing the user to change them in the edit screen (shown below).
      </p>
      <br>
      <img
        src="../images/edit_reminder.png"
        alt="jane-doe"
        loading="lazy"
      />
      <br>
      <p>
        Over the course of three working days, my team was able to develop a working implementation of 
        Siri-created reminders! We utilized Siri Intents and made sure its behavior mimicked that of the 
        prefilling nature. After my mentor helped link Siri Intents with our app, I completed the rest of the logic
        behind processing a request, cleaning it as necessary, and filling out a reminder without the edit stage.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
       By the end of the third day, we presented our work to the senior leadership team, including the CEO, CTO, 
       Head of Engineering, and more. I led the live demo displaying the ability to create vague monthly reminders
       to very specific daily reminders, and our project ended up winning <strong>Best Presentation</strong> and <strong>Most Out of the Box</strong>
       with promises it will likely be put on the project development road map!
      </p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
       This was the first hackathon I had completed in a developer role as well as the first hackathon I had completed with coworkers
       and peers who were much more senior than me. It was insightful working with them in a creative context and seeing what ideas
       and expertise they were able to bring and help materialize over the course of 3 days. It was also fascinating to see from a 
       business point of view the strengths of different ideas, beyond something being cool for a hackathon!
